My name is Fadil Karim, and I am a Computational BIM Technician based in London, specialising in BIM automation, computational design, and data-driven workflows. I have over eight years of experience working across infrastructure, buildings, temporary works, and specialist engineering projects, with a strong focus on Revit, AutoCAD, Bentley OpenBuildings, Grasshopper, Dynamo, and Python. My work centres on replacing repetitive manual modelling with parametric, automated, and AI-assisted systems that improve speed, reliability, and coordination across multidisciplinary teams  ￼.

Since May 2024, I have been working as a BIM Manager at Whitfield Consulting in London. In this role, I lead BIM coordination, 3D modelling, and drawing production for civil and electrical infrastructure projects using Revit, Grasshopper, and Autodesk Construction Cloud. I manage workflows, standards, and client coordination while overseeing delivery quality. I have developed computational scripts in Grasshopper for Revit that automatically place and size columns and fence elements along model lines, as well as tools that place, name, and tag setting-out points at the four corners of elements such as access chambers and foundations. These tools significantly reduce rework and save many hours on live projects  ￼.

Between January 2024 and May 2024, I worked as a Senior BIM Technician at ES Global in London. During this period, I produced 3D models, coordinated information, and delivered drawing packages for scaffold structures used on the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. I also developed computational scripts using Grasshopper and Python for AutoCAD that generated distance tables between structures and surrounding topography for hundreds of elements, enabling rapid checking and reporting workflows  ￼.

From October 2023 to December 2023, I worked as a Computational BIM Technician at Eckersley O’Callaghan in London. I supported VIP residential projects by producing and coordinating reinforced concrete models using Revit, Grasshopper, and Autodesk Construction Cloud. During this time, I developed Grasshopper scripts for Revit that automated the creation, scheduling, and naming of hundreds of beams, as well as the automatic generation of large numbers of named and numbered sheets in seconds, replacing highly repetitive manual processes  ￼.

Between December 2022 and October 2023, I worked as a Senior BIM Technician at Buro Happold in London. My work focused on 3D modelling, coordination, and drawing production for reinforced concrete and steel structures associated with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 projects. I developed Dynamo scripts for Revit that automatically created and placed multiple nodes at structural connection points for complex steel frames, improving consistency and reducing coordination errors  ￼.

From April 2022 to December 2022, I was a Senior BIM Technician at GHD Engineering in London. I worked on reinforced concrete projects in Revit, delivering coordinated models and drawings. I collaborated closely with the BIM Manager to help develop a BIM Execution Plan for a gold mining project, contributing to workflow definition, standards, and coordination procedures  ￼.

Earlier, between January 2022 and March 2022, I worked as a Senior BIM Technician at RDG Engineering in London, producing models and drawings for scaffold structures used across buildings and railway stations. My work focused on accurate 3D modelling, coordination, and constructible outputs for temporary works packages  ￼.

From October 2019 to June 2021, I worked as a Senior BIM Technician at Robert Bird Group in London. During this period, I delivered modelling and drawing production for post-tensioned concrete and steel building structures. I developed parametric workflows and reusable scripts, and expanded my expertise in Python, pyRevit, and Revit Python Shell. I also contributed to internal automation initiatives and reusable computational tools  ￼.

Between February 2019 and October 2019, I worked as a Senior BIM Technician at BG&E in London, producing structural models and drawings while continuing to refine parametric and computational approaches. Prior to this, from February 2016 to December 2017, I worked as a BIM Engineer at Arcadis, where I supported the Thames Tideway Tunnel project. My responsibilities included 3D modelling, coordination, and drawing production in OpenBuildings (AECOsim and MicroStation). I also trained technicians and engineers in OpenBuildings and led the conversion of thousands of drawings from AutoCAD to OpenBuildings, providing ongoing CAD support across teams  ￼.

Alongside my professional roles, I have built a strong foundation in computational tooling and software development. I have created reusable parametric libraries, Grasshopper-based automation systems, and Python tools designed to be model-independent so that BIM models remain robust and editable by non-computational users. I have developed open-source and packaged software, including Python tools distributed via PyPI, built using pandas, NumPy, and Plotly, with full documentation and command-line installation support  ￼.

I also run a YouTube channel with over 7,000 subscribers where I teach Revit and Grasshopper workflows, automation concepts, and BIM best practices. My associated portfolio website hosts downloadable scripts, models, and resources. Teaching and knowledge-sharing form a core part of my professional identity, and I design tools so that they are accessible to technicians with minimal computational background  ￼.

Academically, I completed a Postgraduate Certificate in the Psychology and Neuroscience of Mental Health at King’s College London between 2021 and 2023. I previously earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from the University of Birmingham between 2010 and 2014. I completed my A-levels at St. Joseph’s College from 2008 to 2010, studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Physics  ￼.

Overall, my career sits at the intersection of BIM delivery, computational design, automation, and software thinking. I focus on building robust, reusable, and scalable systems that reduce modelling time, improve coordination quality, and allow engineering teams to work more efficiently without dependence on specialist scripting knowledge.
